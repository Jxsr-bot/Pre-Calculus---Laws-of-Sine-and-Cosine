# Pre-Calculus---Laws-of-Sine-and-Cosine
Im making this just so I could add some things to a resume its a couple different arms of code that all work together in a I guess "Text based" Calculator that seemed to help me a lot through Pre Calculus in Highschool


This isnt a finished project it is my current project that ive tinkered with over the past 3 months this is a small bit of code out of oone of its functions
